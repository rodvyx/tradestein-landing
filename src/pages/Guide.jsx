            2. Use Analytics to Break Patterns You Can’t See
          </h2>

          <p>
            Your analytics dashboard shows you where you are inconsistent, 
            where you excel, and what your emotional tendencies look like.
          </p>

          <ul className="list-disc ml-6 mt-3 space-y-1">

          </h2>

          <p>
            Every dot and every trade on your calendar represents behavior.  
            Good behavior compounds. Poor behavior repeats.
